# DESCRIPTION

First the intended usage scenario: this module has been conceived to shorten 
ids, URLs etc., like the URL shortening services do (then it can be
extended to some other mildly interesting uses: please see the ["COOKBOOK"](#COOKBOOK)
section below).

Then a bit of theory: an id is (or can anyway be mapped to) just a number,
therefore it can be represented in any base. The longer is the alphabet of the
base, the shorter the number representation will be (in terms of symbols of the
said alphabet). This module converts any non-negative decimal integer (including
[Math::BigInt](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Math::BigInt)\-compatible objects) to any given base/alphabet and vice versa,
thus giving the shortest possible representation for the original number/id
(provided that we are dealing with a _collision-free_ transformation of random,
non-skewed data).

The suggested workflow to shorten your ids is therefore the following:

- 1

    when storing an item in your data store, generate a decimal id for it (for example through the SEQUENCE field type offered by many DBMSs);

- 2

    shorten the said decimal id through the ["to\_base"](#to\_base) method explained below;

- 3

    publish the shortened id rather than the (longer) original decimal id.

When receiving a request for a certain item through its corresponding shortened
id you've published:

- 1

    obtain the corresponding original decimal id through the ["to\_dec"](#to\_dec) method explained below;

- 2

    retrieve the requested item in your data store through its original decimal id you've obtained at the previous step;

- 3

    serve the requested item.

Of course one can also save the shortened id along with the item in the data
store, thus saving the `to_dec` conversion at the step 1 above (using the
shortened id rather than the decimal one in the subsequent step 2).

Through the fast native unary increment/decrement offered by the ["next"](#next) and
["prev"](#prev) methods, it is even possible to skip the decimal ids generation and the
conversion steps altogether.

A couple of similar modules were already present on CPAN, but for one reason or
another I did not find them completely satisfactory: for a detailed explanation,
please see the ["COMPARISON"](#COMPARISON) section below.

# METHODS

## Constructors

### `new`

- `Number::AnyBase->new( @alphabet )`
- `Number::AnyBase->new( \@alphabet )`
- `Number::AnyBase->new( $alphabet )`

This is the constructor method, which initializes and returns the _converter_
object. It requires an _alphabet_, that is the set of symbols to represent the
converted numbers (the size of the base is the number of symbols of the provided
alphabet).

An exception is thrown if no alphabet is passed to `new`.

The alphabet can be passed as a list or as a listref of characters, or packed
into a string (in which case the alphabet is obtained by splitting the string
into its individual characters).

For example the following three invocations return exactly the same object:

    $conv = Number::AnyBase->new( '0'..'9', 'a'..'z' );
    

    # Same as above
    $conv = Number::AnyBase->new( ['0'..'9', 'a'..'z'] );
    

    # The same through a string
    $conv = Number::AnyBase->new( '0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' );

An alphabet must have at least two symbols (that is, at least two distinct
characters), otherwise an excpetion is thrown. Any duplicate character is
automatically removed, so for example:

    $conv = Number::AnyBase->new( 'a'..'z', '0'..'9' );
    

    # Exactly the same as above
    $conv = Number::AnyBase->new( 'a'..'z', '0'..'9', qw/a b c d z z z/ );
    

    # Error: an alphabet with a single symbol has been passed
    $conv = Number::AnyBase->new( 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa' );

As a single symbol alphabet is not admissible, when `new` is called with a
single (string) parameter, it is interpreted as a string containing the whole
alphabet and not as a list containing a single (multichar) symbol. In other
words, if you want to pass the alphabet as a list, it must contain at least two
elements.

The alphabet can't contain symbols longer than one character, otherwise an
exception is thrown. Note that this can happen only when the alphabet is passed
as a list or a listref, since when a (single) string is given to `new`, the
alphabet is obtained by splitting the string into its individual characters (and
the possible duplicate characters are removed), so no multichar symbols are ever
created in this case:

    # Error: the last symbol in the provided alphabet (as a list) is two characters long
    Number::AnyBase->new( qw/z z z aa/ );
    

    # This is instead correct since the alphabet will be: 'z', 'a'
    Number::AnyBase->new( 'zzzaa' );

### `fastnew`

- `Number::AnyBase->fastnew( \@alphabet )`

This is an alternative, faster constructor, which skips all of the checks
performed by `new` (if an illegal alphabet is passed, the behavior is
currently indeterminate).

It only accepts a listref.

### Specialized Constructors

Several constructors with ready-made alphabets are offered as well.

#### `new_urisafe`

It builds and returns a converter to/from an alphabet made by the _unreserved
URI characters_, as per the [RFC3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt).
More precisely, it is the same as:

    Number::AnyBase->fastnew( ['-', '.', '0'..'9', 'A'..'Z', '_', 'a'..'z', '~'] );

#### `new_base36`

The same as:

    Number::AnyBase->fastnew( ['0'..'9', 'A'..'Z'] );

#### `new_base62`

The same as:

    Number::AnyBase->fastnew( ['0'..'9', 'A'..'Z', 'a'..'z'] );

#### `new_base64`

The same as:

    Number::AnyBase->fastnew( ['A'..'Z', 'a'..'z', '0'..'9', '+', '/'] );

#### `new_base64url`

The same as:

    Number::AnyBase->fastnew( ['A'..'Z', 'a'..'z', '0'..'9', '-', '_'] );

#### `new_bin`

It builds a binary converter. The same as:

    Number::AnyBase->fastnew( ['0', '1'] );

#### `new_oct`

It builds an octal converter. The same as:

    Number::AnyBase->fastnew( ['0'..'7'] )

#### `new_hex`

It builds an hexadecimal converter. The same as:

    Number::AnyBase->fastnew( ['0'..'9', 'A'..'F'] );

#### `new_hex_lc`

The same as above, except that the alphabet is lower-cased:

    Number::AnyBase->fastnew( ['0'..'9', 'a'..'f'] );

#### `new_dna`

It builds a converter for DNA sequences. The same as:

    Number::AnyBase->fastnew( ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T'] );

#### `new_dna_lc`

The same as above, except that the alphabet is lower-cased:

    Number::AnyBase->fastnew( ['a', 'c', 'g', 't'] );

#### `new_ascii`

It builds and returns a converter to/from an alphabet composed of all the
printable ASCII characters except the space. More precisely, it is the same as:

    Number::AnyBase->fastnew([
        '!', '"' , '#', '$', '%', '&', "'", '(', ')', '*', '+', '-', '.', '/',
        '0'..'9' , ':', ';', '<', '=', '>', '?', '@', 'A'..'Z',
        '[', '\\', ']', '^', '_', '`', 'a'..'z', '{', '|', '}', '~'
    ]);

#### `new_bytes`

It builds a converter to/from an alphabet which includes all the binary octets
from `0x0` to `0xFF`. The same as:

    Number::AnyBase->fastnew( [ map {chr} 0..255 ] );

It is useful to convert from/to binary data (for an example, please see the
["DNA Compression"](#DNA Compression) or the ["Binary-to-text Encoding"](#Binary-to-text Encoding) recipes in the
["COOKBOOK"](#COOKBOOK) section below).

## `to_base`

- `$string = $converter->to_base( $decimal )`

This is the method which transforms the given decimal number into its
representation in the new base, as shown in the ["SYNOPSIS"](#SYNOPSIS) above.

It works only on decimal non-negative integers (including `0`). For speed
reasons, no check is performed on the given number: in case it is illegal, the
behavior is currently indeterminate.

It works transparently also on [Math::BigInt](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Math::BigInt)\-compatible objects (that is, any
object which overloads the arithmetic operators like [Math::BigInt](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Math::BigInt) does): just
pass any such _big number_ and you will get the correct result:

    use Math::BigInt; # Or use Math::GMP;
    Math::BigInt->accuracy(60); # For example
    

    my $bignum = Math::BigInt->new( '123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890' ); # Or Math::GMP->new(...)
    

    my $conv = Number::AnyBase->new_base62;
    

    my $base_num = $conv->to_base( $bignum ); # sK0FUywPQsEhMwNhdPBZJcA9KumP0WpD0

This permits to freely choose any [Math::BigInt](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Math::BigInt) _option_ (the
_accuracy_, as shown above, or the _backend library_ etc.), or to use any
other compatible class, such as, for example, [Math::GMP](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Math::GMP) or [Math::Int128](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Math::Int128)
(in this latter case, if the number size permits its use).

## `to_dec`

- `$decimal_number = $converter->to_base( $base_num )`
- `$decimal_bignumber = $converter->to_base( $base_num, $bigint_obj )`

This is the method which converts the transformed _number_ (or rather
_string_) back to its decimal representation, as exemplified in the
["SYNOPSIS"](#SYNOPSIS) above.

For speed reasons, no check is performed on the given string, which could be
inconsistent (for example because it contains characters not present in the
current alphabet): in this case the behavior is currently indeterminate.

It accepts a second optional parameter, which should be a
[Math::BigInt](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Math::BigInt)\-compatible object (it does not matter if it is initialized or
not), which tells `to_base` that a _bignum_ result is requested. It is
necessary only when the result is too large to be held by a native perl
integer (though, other than slowing down the conversion, it does not cause
any harm, so in case of doubt it can be used anyway).

The passed bignum object is then used for the internal calculations so, though
unusual, this interface permits to have the maximum flexibility, as it
completely decouples the _bignum_ library, allowing the user to freely choose
any [Math::BigInt](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Math::BigInt) _option_ as well as any (faster) [Math::BigInt](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Math::BigInt)\-compatible
alternative (such as [Math::GMP](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Math::GMP), or [Math::Int128](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Math::Int128) when permitted by the
number size):

    use Math::BigInt; # Or use Math::GMP;
    Math::BigInt->accuracy(60); # For example
    

    my $conv = Number::AnyBase->new_base62;
    

    my $big_dec_num = $conv->to_dec( 'sK0FUywPQsEhMwNhdPBZJcA9KumP0WpD0', Math::BigInt->new ); # Or Math::GMP->new
    # $big_dec_num is now a Math::BigInt object which stringifies to:
    # 123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890

## `next`

- `$string = $converter->next( $base_num )`

This method performs an optimized _native_ unary increment on the given
converted number/string, returning the next number/string in the current base
(see also the ["SYNOPSYS"](#SYNOPSYS) above):

    $next_base_num = $converter->next($base_num);

It is over 2x faster than the conversion roundtrip:

    $next_base_num = $converter->to_base( $converter->to_dec($base_num) + 1 );

(see the `benchmark/native\_sequence.pl` benchmark included in the
distribution). It therefore offers an efficient way to get the next id from the
last (converted) id stored in a db, for example.

## `prev`

- `$string = $converter->prev( $base_num )`

This method performs an optimized _native_ unary decrement on the given
converted number/string, returning the previous number/string in the current
base (see also the ["SYNOPSYS"](#SYNOPSYS) above):

    $prev_base_num = $converter->prev($base_num);

It is over 2x faster than the conversion roundtrip:

    $prev_base_num = $converter->to_base( $converter->to_dec($base_num) - 1 );

When called on the _zero_ of the base, it returns `undef`.

## `alphabet`

- `$listref = $converter->alphabet`

Read-only method which returns the alphabet of the current _target_ base, as a
listref.

# COOKBOOK

This section contains some general advices, together with some examples of
_creative_ uses, if a bit extravagant :-)

## DNA Compression

This example shows how the _bytes_ alphabet can be used to effectively compress
random data, when expressed in a shorter alphabet (the _DNA alphabet_ in
this case).

If the data are sufficiently randomized (i.e. not skewed), this technique easily
beats most general purpose compression algorithms.

As shown below, the conversion to the bytes alphabet produces about a 40%
better compression than zip (with default options).
Even the conversions to the _urisafe_ and to the printable ascii alphabets
offer a better compression, and they have the additional advantage  that the
produced string has only _safe_ characters.

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    

    use feature 'say';
    

    use Number::AnyBase;
    use Math::BigInt; # Or use Math::GMP for speed
    

    # For comparison
    use IO::Compress::Zip qw(zip);
    

    $| = 1;
    

    ( my $dnastring = do { local $/; <DATA> } ) =~ tr/\n//d;
    

    # dna string in decimal form (itself a compression)
    my $dnastring_dec = Number::AnyBase->new_dna->to_dec($dnastring, Math::BigInt->new);
    

    # Let's try several compressions
    my $dnastring_urisafe = Number::AnyBase->new_urisafe->to_base($dnastring_dec);
    my $dnastring_ascii   = Number::AnyBase->new_ascii->to_base($dnastring_dec);
    my $dnastring_bytes   = Number::AnyBase->new_bytes->to_base($dnastring_dec);
    

    # zip with default options for comparison
    zip \$dnastring, \my $dnastring_zipped;
    

    # Check the length
    say length $dnastring;         # 1231 (original length)
    say length $dnastring_dec;     #  741
    say length $dnastring_urisafe; #  408
    say length $dnastring_ascii;   #  377
    say length $dnastring_bytes;   #  308
    

    say length $dnastring_zipped;  #  515

    CTCCAGGCACCCTTCTTTCCTCTTCCCCTTGCCCTTGCCCTGACCTCCCAGCCCTATGGATGTGGGGTCCCCATC
    ATCCCAGCTGCTCCCAAATAAACTCCAGAAG

Of course there is nothing magic here: this technique simply leads to a 2-bit
representation for the original symbols (being them just 4).
For truly random data, this is the best that can be done however (compression
algorithms specifically tailored for DNA sequences there exist, but they still
leverage on some data pattern repetitions to get better results).

## Binary-to-text Encoding

In a sense, this example is the opposite of the previous one: this time the
target alphabet is shorter than the source one, therefore the resulting string
is longer than the original one. There is an advantage however: the resulting
string contains only _safe_ characters (while the original string is in general
binary), and it can therefore be trasmitted/embedded where binary data would
have caused problems.

Working on the whole original string rather than on blocks, the technique shown
below easily beats any binary-to-text standard algorithm (the efficiency of
which is measured by the shortness of the overhead added to the original data),
such as [Base64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)
or [Ascii85](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii85), even with the  optimizations
offered by default by the [Convert::Ascii85](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Convert::Ascii85) CPAN module used here for
comparison (to be fair, the `Number::AnyBase` ascii alphabet has also more than
85 symbols, but that's an `Number::AnyBase` merit :-)

Also note how, in order to maximize the efficiency, `Number::AnyBase` lets
freely choose the bignum library (in this case the excellent `Math::GMP`),
even when converting (to decimals) from arbitrary alphabets.

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    

    use feature 'say';
    

    use Number::AnyBase;
    use Math::GMP; # For speed
    

    # For Comparison
    use MIME::Base64;
    use Convert::Ascii85 qw(ascii85_encode);
    

    $| = 1;
    

    # Generic binary data
    my $bytes = '';
    $bytes .= chr int(256 * rand) for 1..1024;
    

    # byte string in decimal form
    my $bytes_dec = Number::AnyBase->new_bytes->to_dec($bytes, Math::GMP->new);
    

    my $bytes_base64 = Number::AnyBase->new_base64->to_base($bytes_dec);
    my $bytes_ascii  = Number::AnyBase->new_ascii->to_base($bytes_dec);
    

    say length $bytes; # Original length
    

    say length $bytes_base64;
    say length encode_base64($bytes); # Longer than $bytes_base64
    

    say length $bytes_ascii;
    say length ascii85_encode($bytes); # Longer than $bytes_ascii

The downside is that this technique becomes impractical (both in time and
space efficiency) when the string to convert grows. It can however be applied
block-by-block, say up to blocks of (few) tens of Kbytes, still producing
the best results.

## UUIDs compression

This example is a mix of the previous two: using a longer alphabet, it
compresses the original (hexadecimal) UUID, but it keeps also the UUID textual.

Once again it is shown how, in order to maximize the efficiency,
`Number::AnyBase` can freely choose the bignum library to use: in this case the
excellent `Math::Int128` (which fits perfectly, being an UUID exactly 128-bit
long).

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    

    use feature 'say';
    

    use Math::Int128 qw(string_to_uint128); # For maximum speed
    use Data::UUID;
    use Number::AnyBase;
    

    $| = 1;
    

    my $uuid = Data::UUID->new->create_hex;
    my $dec_uuid = string_to_uint128($uuid);
    

    # Let's try several compressions
    my $base64url_uuid = Number::AnyBase->new_base64url->to_base($dec_uuid);
    my $urisafe_uuid   = Number::AnyBase->new_urisafe->to_base($dec_uuid);
    my $ascii_uuid     = Number::AnyBase->new_ascii->to_base($dec_uuid);
    

    # Check the length
    say length($uuid) - 2;      # Original length (32)
    say length $base64url_uuid; # Max. 22, better than standard Base64
    say length $urisafe_uuid;   # Max. 22, sometimes better than the previous
    say length $ascii_uuid;     # Max. 20, better than standard Base85

## Security

This module focuses only on converting numbers from decimals to any 
base/alphabet and vice versa, therefore it has nothing to do with security, 
that is, given a number/string and the alphabet it is represented on, the 
next (through an unary increment) number/string is guessable. If you want 
your (converted) id sequence not to be guessable, the solution is however 
simple: just randomize your decimal numbers upfront, leaving large random gaps 
in the set. Then feed the randomized decimals to this module to have them 
shortened.

## Sorting

Characters ordering in the given alphabet does matter: if it is desidered that
converting a sorted sequence of decimals produces a sorted sequence of strings
(when properly padded of course), the characters in the provided alphabet must
be sorted as well.

An alphabet with unsorted characters can be used to make the converted
numbers somewhat harder to guess.

Note that the predefined constructors always use sorted alphabets.

## Speed

For maximum speed, as a constructor use `fastnew` or any of the predefined
constructors, resorting to `new` only when it is necessary to perform the extra
checks.

Conversion speed maximization does not require any trick: as long as
_big numbers_ are not used, the calculations are performed at the full perl
native integers speed.

Big numbers of course slow down the conversions but, as shown above,
performances can be fine-tuned, for example by properly setting the
[Math::BigInt](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Math::BigInt) precision and accuracy, by choosing a faster back-end library,
or by using [Math::GMP](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Math::GMP) directly in place of [Math::BigInt](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Math::BigInt) (advised).
If permitted by the number size, [Math::Int128](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Math::Int128) is an even faster alternative.

As already said, the optimized native unary increment \[decrement\] provided by
`next` \[`prev`\] is over 2x faster than the `to_dec`/`to_base` conversion
rountrip. However, if a sequence of converted numbers must be generated, and
such sequence is large enough so that the first `to_dec()` call can be
amortized, using `to_base()` (only) is marginally faster than using `next`:

    use Number::AnyBase;
    

    use constant SEQ_LENGTH => 10_000;

# COMPARISON

Here is a brief and __completely biased__ comparison with [Math::BaseCalc](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Math::BaseCalc),
[Math::BaseConvert](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Math::BaseConvert) and [Math::Base::Convert](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Math::Base::Convert), which are similar CPAN modules.

For the performance claims, please see the
`benchmark/other\_cpan\_modules.pl` benchmark script included in the
distribution. Also note that the conversion speed gaps tend to increase with the
numbers size.

- vs `Math::BaseCalc`
    - Pros
        - `Number::AnyBase` is faster: decimal->base conversion is about 2x (100%) faster, base->decimal conversion is about on par, `fastnew` is about 20% faster than `Math::BaseCalc::new`.
        - Base->decimal conversion in `Number::AnyBase` can return `Math::BigInt` (or _similar_) objects upon request, while `Math::BaseCalc` only returns native perl integers, thus producing wrong results when the decimal number is too large.
        - `Math::BaseCalc` lacks the fast native unary increment/decrement offered by `Number::Anybase`, which permits an additional 2x speedup.
    - Cons
        - `Math::BaseCalc::new` converts also negative integers, while `Number::AnyBase` only converts non-negative integers (this feature has been considered not particularly important and therefore traded for speed in `Number::AnyBase`).
- vs `Math::BaseConvert`
    - Pros
        - With native perl integers, `Number::AnyBase` is hugely faster: something like 200x faster in decimal->base conversion and 130x faster in base->decimal conversion (using `Math::BaseConvert::cnv`).
        - With big integers (60 digits), `Number::AnyBase` (using `Math::GMP`) is still faster: over 13x faster in both decimal->base conversion and base->decimal conversion; though much less, it's faster even using `Math::BigInt` with its pure-perl backend.
        - `Math::BaseConvert` has a weird API: first it has a functional interface, which is not ideal for code which has to maintain its internal state. Then, though a custom alphabet can be set (through a state-changing function called `dig`), every time `cnv` is called, the _target_ alphabet size must be passed anyway.
        - `Math::BaseConvert` doesn't permit to use a bignum library other than `Math::BigInt`, nor it permits to set any `Math::BigInt` option.
        - `Math::BaseConvert` lacks the fast native unary increment/decrement offered by `Number::Anybase`, which permits an additional 2x speedup.
    - Cons
        - `Math::BaseConvert` manages big numbers transparently (but this makes it extremely slow and does not permit to use a library other than `Math::BigInt`, as already said).
        - `Math::BaseConvert` can convert numbers between two arbitrary bases with a single function call.
        - `Math::BaseConvert` converts also negative integers.
- vs `Math::Base::Convert`
    - Pros
        - With native perl integers, `Number::AnyBase` is largely faster: something like over 15x faster in decimal->base conversion and over 22x faster in base->decimal conversion (using the `Math::Base::Convert` object API, which is the recommended one for speed); `fastnew` is over 70% faster than `Math::Base::Convert::new`.
        - With big integers (60 digits), `Number::AnyBase` (using `Math::GMP`) is still faster: about 15% faster in decimal->base conversion and about 100% faster in base->decimal conversion.
        - Though generally better, `Math::Base::Convert` preserves some of the `Math::BaseConvert` API shortcomings: to convert numbers bidirectionally between base 10 to/from another given base, two different objects must be istantiated (or the bases must be passed each time through the functional API).
        - `Math::Base::Convert` lacks the fast native unary increment/decrement offered by `Number::Anybase`, which permits an additional 2x speedup.
        - Possible minor glitch: some of the predefined alphabets offered by `Math::Base::Convert` are not sorted.
    - Cons
        - `Math::Base::Convert` manages big numbers transparently and natively, i.e. without resorting to `Math::BigInt` or similar modules (but, though not as slow as `Math::BaseConvert`, this makes `Math::Base::Convert` massively slow as well, when native perl integers can be used).
        - On big integers, if `Number::AnyBase` uses `Math::BigInt` with its pure-perl engine, `Math::Base::Convert` is faster: about 11x in decimal->base conversion and about 6x in in base->decimal conversion (as already said, `Number::AnyBase` can however use `Math::GMP` and be faster even with big numbers).
        - `Math::Base::Convert` can convert numbers between two arbitrary bases with a single function call.
        - `Math::Base::Convert` converts also negative integers.

All of the reviewed modules are _pure-perled_, though the `Math::GMP` module
that `Number::AnyBase` can (optionally) use to maximize its speed with big
numbers it's not.
Note however that the `Number::AnyBase` fast native unary increment/decrement
work on arbitrarily big numbers without any external module.
